    <h1>The Project</h1>
    <p>
      The Dart Linux Project aims to be a <b>fully systemd-free distro</b>,
      completely using <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox"><b>BusyBox</b></a> and some coreutils from GNU, like Bash.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has a simple service language, it is mostly fbcon-based terminal,
      but you can choose what WM to install.
      For now we are avoiding X11
      and Wayland (They're <b>RAM Eaters</b>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this project is <b>almost lightweight</b> to fit in an embedded system,
      we are starting to add <b>i686 (x86) support</b> in our ports, and coming
      soon, <b>ARM support</b>.

    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      Meet the master of everything, <b>Saveriokarol</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      This site was written by him, he's 13 years old, yes, you understood it correctly, by a 13 YEAR OLD!
      He's the master of webpages, both frontend and backend, and Linux Developer. He's always called the idea-spammer.
      I'd NOT recommend opening the browser toolkit and seeing what's at the top of the HTML code...
    </p>
    <p>
      Meet the master of falling asleep, <b>Vinnie</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      No explanation why he's there but he only falls asleep for such no reason, sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meet the master of chilling, <b>Shrub</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      He's a chill coder, always picking the fork and 
      stabbing it to the other projects, like 9wm. He did a fork
      of 9wm, called shrub9! The first fan he got was obviously Saveriokarol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meet the master of the Wiki-man, <b>Vinam</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't mind me how long are his paragraphs:
    </p>
    <p>
      He hasnt due to the rules of semantic versioning
      MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
      MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
      MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
      PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
      eg Linux 5.x and Linux 6.x work differently and until Linux 6 needs to change or add something significant enough to make it incompatible with applications that ran on Linux 6 (called a breaking change) there will be no Linux 7
      there ya go
    </p>
    <p>
      Meet the master of memes everywhere, <b>Doruk</b>!
    </p>
